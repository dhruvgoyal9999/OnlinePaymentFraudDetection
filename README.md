**ONLINE PAYMENTS FRAUD DETECTION**

**Project Description:**

The rise of the internet and e-commerce has increased reliance on online credit/debit card 
transactions. However, this increase in utilisation has also resulted in an increase in fraud instances. 
Detecting these scams is difficult, as different approaches have variable degrees of accuracy and their 
own set of limitations. Monitoring transaction behaviour for any deviations is necessary for predicting 
and resolving fraud. Given the large quantity of data involved, the suggested solution addresses the 
credit/debit card fraud detection issue
Classification methods such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Extra Tree Classifier, and XGBoost 
Classifier are used in our strategy. We intend to determine the most successful model through 
rigorous training and testing. Once the best model has been found, it will be stored in pkl format. 
Flask integration enabling easy web application development and deployment on IBM infrastructure 
are the next steps.
